AffordIt determines the maximum affordable price of a home given gross income, allowable debt ratio, 
30-year fixed APR, property tax rate, annual home insurance cost, mortgage insurance rate, HOA, 
and other monthly debt.

Eventually, AffordIt? will also act as a SaaS back end tool, loading it's variables via XML and 
returning an XML output including a full budget layout.

Please, use this tool and buy a home within your budget. See a loan officer for 30-year fixed APR rates and 
what fraction of your gross income they'll allow you to spend on debt. Then use this tool to determine 
the maximum price you can afford. Buy a cheaper home and prosper in good health.
